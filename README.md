First I share the project from Pychram to Github by used
Then i create folder .github directly in Github web browser that's make it easier to create workflows folder too
Then i gor create the run-test.yaml but i got error by used pytest command and got help by student assistance
to fix the error we found out that my code it had only method and it will not print out anything
student assistance help me to fix it by edit the code by changing from pytest to unittest and it work!

then i push and commit the code to git and try to run the test ans still got an error 
becuase i ran the test by use pytest test_leapyear.yp
I changed the command to python -m unittest test_leapyear.py
Then i try to run the test again and everything work just fine.
